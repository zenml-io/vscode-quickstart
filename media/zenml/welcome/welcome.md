# Welcome to the ZenML Quickstart Guide ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the ZenML Quickstart Guide. This vscode extension running in codespaces gives you a sandboxed place to explore using ZenML.

This repository is a minimalistic MLOps project intended as a starting point to learn how to put ML workflows in production. It features:

- A feature engineering pipeline that loads data and prepares it for training.
- A training pipeline that loads the preprocessed dataset and trains a model.
- A batch inference pipeline that runs predictions on the trained model with new data.

Follow along this notebook to understand how you can use ZenML to productionalize your ML workflows!
