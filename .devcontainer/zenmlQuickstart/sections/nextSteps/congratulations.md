# Congratulations!

You're a legit MLOps engineer now! You trained two models, evaluated them against
a test set, registered the best one with the ZenML model control plane,
and served some predictions. You also learned how to iterate on your models and
data by using some of the ZenML utility abstractions. You saw how to view your
artifacts and models via the client as well as the ZenML Dashboard.

## Further exploration

This was just the tip of the iceberg of what ZenML can do; check out the [**docs**](https://docs.zenml.io/) to learn more
about the capabilities of ZenML. For example, you might want to:

- [Deploy ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/connect-deployed-zenml) to collaborate with your colleagues.
- Run the same pipeline on a [cloud MLOps stack in production](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/cloud-stack).
- Track your metrics in an experiment tracker like [MLflow](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/component-guide/experiment-trackers/mlflow).

## What next?

* If you have questions or feedback... join our [**Slack Community**](https://zenml.io/slack) and become part of the ZenML family!
* If you want to quickly get started with ZenML, check out the [ZenML Cloud](https://zenml.io/cloud).
